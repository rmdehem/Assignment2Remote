Steps	to	perform:
1. Create	a	new	folder	for	this	assignment.
2. Initialize	git	for	version	control	of	this	assignment	artifact.
3. Create	new	file	called	README.	Populate	its	content	with	description	of	the	goal
of	this	project.
4. Add	this	file	in	version	control.
5. Commit	the	changes	with	proper	comment.
6. Create	remote	repository	and	push	existing	content	in	it.
7. Create	a	working	branch	with	your	user	name.
8. Check	out	your	named	branch	just	created.
9. Create	a	new	file	in	this	folder	called	BeerSong.java
10. Add	 empty	Main()	 and	 Ninety_Nine_Bottles_of_Beer()	 functions	 that	 performs
following	task.
================== Program	Specification	=========================
Main	function	calls	Ninety_Nine_Bottles_of_Beer()		Function to	print the	“99	Bottles
of	 Beer”	 song.	 Through	 this	exercise,	 you	 will	enhance	 your java programing skills
further	including GIT	version control	and	problem	solving.	Assume	that	your console
is	a	wall where	the	song	will	be	written	once	your	code	compiles	and	executes.
***************	Program	output	***************************
99	bottles	of	beer	on	the	wall,	99	bottles	of	beer
take	one	down,	pass	it	around,	98	bottles	of	beer	on	the	wall.
98	bottles	of	beer	on	the	wall,	98	bottles	of	beer
take	one	down,	pass	it	around,	97	bottles	of	beer	on	the wall.
97	bottles	of	beer	on	the	wall,	97	bottles	of	beer

1	bottle	of	beer	on	the	wall,	1	bottle	of	beer
take	one	down,	pass	it	around,	no	more	bottles	of	beer	on	the	wall.
***************	End	program	output	***********************
11. Add	the	file	to	repository	and	commit	it	with	comments.
12. Push	the	content	to	remote	repository.
13. Create and	checkout new	branch	called	“implementation”
14. Implement	each	method	in	this	branch	and	ensure	that	there	is	no	programming
error	pertaining	to	code	in	each	method.
15. For	 every	 method	 implemented,	 you	 must	 commit	 those	 changes	 with
appropriate	comment	in	working	repository	as	well	as	remote	repository.
16. Push	all	commits	and	content	to	remote	repository.
17. Print	the	log	of	all	the	changes	you	have	made	during	entire	development	cycle
of	this	assignment.	Print	it	out	and	submit	its	hard	copy	with	your	source	code	by
due	date.
